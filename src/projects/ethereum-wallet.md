  MyEthvault is an open source application that allows users to interact with
  dApps on the Ethereum blockchain without leaving the browser. Currently in the
  prototype phase, my role has been to develop a brand aesthetic as well as
  working on the front-end React application. This app is a first of its kind which
  means a blank canvas when it comes to designing experience and interface patterns.
