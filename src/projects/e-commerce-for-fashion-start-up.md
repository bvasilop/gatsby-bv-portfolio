  MaiBee are a vintage clothing retailer, they had gained a huge following on
  social media and their business was taking off. The only issue was the lack of
  a business website and brand. I helped them created an adaptable brand system
  as well as designing and developing a completely bespoke Shopify theme.

      98.7% of traffic to maibee.com is on smartphones. With most of that coming
      straight from their Instagram. The primary focus was making the experience
      on mobile as easy to use a s possible.
