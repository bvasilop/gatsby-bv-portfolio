  Designed, curated and implemented a pattern library for Osborne Clarke. Their
  websites function is to serve insightful content to prospective clients.
  Therefore the focus of my work was creating a robust, responsive typography
  scale and designing interactive, animated components that allow users to
  browse top level information whilst browsing the site.
