  IDD regulations introduced in 2018 meant consumers had to understand every
  item in their insurance product. I worked on the agile prototyping team that
  designed and user tested the succesful solution for the RAC. My role within
  the team focused primarily on UI design and interface animation. Our
  deliverable for this project was a fully interactive code prototype.

      Before begining the project we mapped out current and prospective journeys
      by conducting in depth user research of both the RAC and competitor
      payment journeys.
