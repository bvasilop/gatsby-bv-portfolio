  My portfolio website
</h1>
<p>
Built with React, Gatsby and animated with React Spring. I use Netlify CMS to store all my projects. Feel free to play around, I'm always looking for feedback on how I can improve my work.

## ðŸš€ To start

1. **Yarn**

   I used yarn as my package manager. Use the yarn command in the terminal to install all dependencies.

   ```sh
     cd gatsby-portfolio/
     yarn
   ```

1) **Start developing.**

   Start using the yarn start command. I've also added a "yarn pull-content" command if you have made updates on the CMS this will pull down the content changes and refresh the cache, avoiding issues with gatsby-image.

   ```sh
   yarn start
   ```

   or

   ```sh
   yarn pull-content
   ```
